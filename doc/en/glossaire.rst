   refinement
      The refinement is an operation that consists in splitting the selected elements.

   level
      The level of an element corresponds to the number of splitting that were done to obtain it. The levem of the elements in the initial mesh is 0.

   unrefinement
      The unrefinement is an operation that consists in removing the selected elements. In fact, the objective is to cancel a previous splitting: a 'higher' level than the initial mesh cannot be obtained.

   zone
      A zone is a region that may govern the adaptation: every element with at least 2 nodes inside the zone is split or removed, depending on the choice.

   case
      A case is defined with an initial mesh and a list of adaptations.

   error indicator
      The error indicator is a field that is expressed over the elements. It represents an estimation of the error between the real solution and the computed solution.

   iteration
      An iteration is the process that transform a mesh to another one into a case. An iteration implies refinement and/or unrefinement, following the associated hypothesis.

   hypothesis
      An hypothesis describes the conditions that governs the modification from a mesh to another one: refinement and/or unrefinement, etc. An hypothesis is referenced by 1 or more iterations.

   field
      A field is expressed over a mesh, onto node or element, with 1 or more components.

   MED
      It is the excange format for the meshes and the fields in SALOME.
