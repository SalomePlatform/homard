About SALOME Homard
*******************

SALOME Homard module drives the mesh adaptation inside the SALOME platform.

It is intended to adapt the meshes within the framework of the computer codes
by finite elements or finite volumes, via the usage of the "homard" utility.
This utility proceeds by refinement and unrefinement of the two-dimensional
or three-dimensional meshes. It is conceived to be used independently of the
computer code with which it is coupled.

--------------
Pre-requisites
--------------

SALOME platform relies on a set of third-party softwares; some of them are needed
at build time only, while other ones are needed in runtime also.

For more information about the pre-requisites please visit SALOME platform web
site:

* Check Release Notes and Software Requirements of the latest SALOME release at

  <http://www.salome-platform.org/downloads/current-version/>

* Pre-requisites page at SALOME web site:

  <http://www.salome-platform.org/downloads/license/>

Note: SALOME Homard module needs SALOME KERNEL, SALOME GUI, SALOME Geometry and
SALOME Mesh as pre-requisites.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

The build procedure of the SALOME platform is implemented with CMake.
In order to build the module you have to do the following actions: 

1. Set up environment for pre-requisites (see "Pre-requisites" section above).

2. Create a build directory:

   % mkdir HOMARD_BUILD

3. Configure the build procedure:

   % cd HOMARD_BUILD
   % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_directory> <path_to_src_dir>

   where
   - <mode> is either Release or Debug (default: Release);
   - <installation_directory> is a destination folder to install SALOME Homard
      module (default: /usr); 
   - <path_to_src_dir> is a path to the SALOME Homard sources directory.

   Note: by default (if CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option is not given), SALOME Homard
   module will be configured for installation to the /usr directory that requires
   root permissions to complete the installation.

4. Build and install:

   % make
   % make install

   This will install SALOME Homard module to the <installation_directory>
   specified to cmake command on the previous step.

-------------------
Custom installation
-------------------

SALOME Homard module supports a set of advanced configuration options;
for more details learn CMakeLists.txt file in the root source directory.

You can also use other options of cmake command to customize your installation.
Learn more about available options by typing

   % cmake --help
